# Local desktop router contract

For cross-harness child agents, see [shared delegation](shared-delegation.md).

The local router must implement the desktop's task-creation transaction, not only
`thread/start` followed immediately by `turn/start`. This reference was checked
against the installed desktop build 20156, bundled Codex CLI
`0.162.0-alpha.17.2`, and Claudex's vendored `0.160.0` schema. The metadata and
settings contracts below already exist in that vendored schema.

## Creation and submission

1. The desktop reads config and lists models. Genuine Codex owns config, project
   administration and its own chats; the router adds the Claude model catalog.
2. The desktop starts or reuses an empty prewarmed thread. When no model is sent,
   the router reads genuine Codex's effective config for that cwd. A saved Claude
   default must select Claude, rather than creating a Codex chat with that model.
3. Before submitting the first message, the desktop persists project placement
   through `thread/metadata/update`. Projectless tasks still call this method,
   with `projectId: ""`. The facade saves the assignment and returns the thread;
   this must not be acknowledged as a no-op. The desktop/genuine Codex project
   registry owns the project identities.
4. Model and permission selections can call `thread/settings/update` before the
   turn. Claude accepts idle-thread updates, saves the resulting settings and
   emits `thread/settings/updated`. A still-empty Codex thread can migrate to
   Claude at this point or when its first Claude turn arrives. Project and Git
   metadata must survive that migration.
5. The desktop's final `turn/start` request contains both execution settings and
   client context. `collaborationMode.settings.model` takes precedence over the
   top-level model, matching both backends. Routing and normalization must agree
   about this selection. Completed chats remain on their original backend.
6. Resume restores the facade subscription before a follow-up turn. Reads,
   metadata patches, names and archive operations continue to address the same
   thread identity and persisted record.

Current source evidence: `.vite/build/main-CqEoQDOU.js`, project-assignment
`write` near character offset 2599745; `.vite/build/src-BJv5Mk7n.js`, thread-settings update
near 874722, thread-start request preparation near 891254, prewarm preparation
near 895892, and the final turn expression near 828990. Extracted app code stays
outside the repository. `scripts/extract-desktop-turn-fixture.mjs` evaluates the
final expression with controlled inputs; the checked-in fixture records the
bundle and expression SHA-256 hashes so it can be refreshed deliberately.

Codex's injected `mcp_servers.node_repl`, `memories.version`, and
`memories.dual_write` configuration describes its own runtime. Claude warns and
uses native memory/MCP configuration. Approval and sandbox settings retain their
native semantics; workspace tests use the desktop's actual workspace-write and
automatic-review payload, rather than substituting full access.

## Service lifecycle

A Claude service restart must not turn a Claude model into a Codex model. The
router retains learned model/thread ownership, reports a temporary reconnect
error for Claude requests, and reconnects the private socket while keeping the
Codex child alive. It restores the handshake/catalog and resumes a thread's
subscription before its next turn. It never automatically replays a submitted
message. Codex requests continue to work during the outage. The desktop's own
connection stays up, so when the facade goes away the router ends the Claude
turns the desktop saw start (`turn/completed` as interrupted, then an idle
status) and resolves their outstanding server requests; the restarted facade
records the same turns as interrupted.

Routing facts are scoped. While the router waits on the facade for one thread
(its ownership probe, subscription before a turn, or adoption), only that
thread's later requests wait, in order; other chats and genuine Codex requests
proceed. Only the Claude catalog and the saved default model, which decide
where a new thread goes, hold every request.

## Validation and limits

`tests/router.rs` covers projectless creation with the extracted turn payload,
metadata and settings before first submission, metadata-preserving migration,
saved defaults, first/follow-up turns, resume, and service restart. `tests/wire.rs`
checks metadata persistence and upstream response/notification schemas. The
native integration probe repeats creation, two real workspace/auto-review Opus
turns, restart, another turn on the same router, metadata/rename/archive, and a native Bash printf with captured command output.
The test-only fake Claude reports a simulated managed-policy control state; it
is not evidence that an OS sandbox is enforced.

This remains a supported protocol subset. Plan mode, read-only profiles and
mutations of settings for an already-running native turn are not implemented.
Idle settings updates must not claim to change a running turn's reviewer/model.
These limits are distinct from the basic desktop create-task/submit transaction.
